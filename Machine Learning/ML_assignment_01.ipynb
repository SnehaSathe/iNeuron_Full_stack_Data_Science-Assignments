    "**Ans :** Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) focused on the development of algorithms and models that enable computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data, without being explicitly programmed to do so. In other words, it is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. Machine learning algorithms iteratively learn patterns and relationships from data, allowing them to improve their performance over time without human intervention. These algorithms are widely used in various applications such as image recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, predictive analytics, and many more."

    "*Ans :** In machine learning, a labeled training set is a collection of input data samples, where each sample is associated with one or more output labels that serve as the ground truth for the problem at hand. Using a labeled training set is to enable a machine learning model to learn how to map inputs to outputs by learning from examples to make accurate predictions on new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how a labeled training set works:<br>\n",
    "\r\n",
    "**Data Collection:** Initially, a dataset is collected or generated, comprising input features and corresponding labels. For example, in a classification task to distinguish between cats and dogs in images, each image (input feature) would be paired with a label indicating whether it contains a cat or a dog.\r",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Training Process:** The labeled training set is used to train a machine learning model. During training, the model learns patterns and relationships between the input features and the corresponding labels. The goal is for the model to generalize from the training data and accurately predict labels for new, unseen data.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Learning:** The machine learning algorithm iteratively adjusts its parameters or internal representations based on the examples in the labeled training set. Through techniques like gradient descent, the algorithm minimizes the discrepancy between its predictions and the true labels in the training data.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Evaluation:** After training, the model's performance is evaluated using a separate dataset called the validation set or test set. This dataset contains examples that the model has not seen during training. By comparing the model's predictions to the true labels in the validation set, its accuracy, precision, recall, or other performance metrics are assessed.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deployment:** Once the model demonstrates satisfactory performance on the validation set, it can be deployed to make predictions on new, unseen data in real-world applications. The model applies the learned patterns from the labeled training set to make predictions or classifications for new instances.a.instances."
